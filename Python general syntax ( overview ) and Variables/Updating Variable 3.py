Changing the contents of a variable is one of the essential operations. As the flow of a program progresses, data should be updated to reflect changes that have happened.

Now imagine the situation from past examples, but instead of buying a sandwich, you meet a friend and he will return you a debt, the money that he borrowed from you

Declare variables money_in_wallet, money_borrowed, where money_in_wallet holds value 100 and money_borrowed holds value 50, then output total amount of money you gained
____________________________________
case = Test1
output = 150
____________________________________
money_in_wallet = 100
money_borrowed = 50
money_in_wallet += money_borrowed
print(money_in_wallet)
