In Python, and when programming in general, we need to build systems for dealing with data that changes over time.
Python uses variables to define things that are subject to change.

Example: date = 2019

Create a variable called date and assign a value that will represent todayâ€™s year to that variable.

Then output value of this variable on a separate line
____________________________________
case = Test1
output = "2020"
____________________________________
date = 2020
print(date)
