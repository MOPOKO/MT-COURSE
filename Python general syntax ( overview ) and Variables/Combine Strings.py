A string, so named because they’re a series of letters, numbers, or symbols connected in order — as if threaded together by string.

Example: "IAU2020" or "2020" or "IAU"

Deploy two variables which holds values "a" and "b", where "a" equals to the 2020, and "b" equals "a2" respectively.

And using "+" operator, output two values near to each other on the new line.

Attention: You work with strings not integers
