Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and other numeric calculations are easy to do in most programming languages, and Python is no exception. 

Example: 

addition = 2020 + 2020

subtraction = 2020 - 2019

multiplication = 12 * 12

division = 36 / 3

reminder = 15 % 2



Multiply two numbers a and b together and assign the result to variable called answer, where "a" holds value of today's year, and "b" holds value 1

Then print out answer 
____________________________________
case = Test1
output = 2020
____________________________________
a = 2020
b = 1
print(a*b)
