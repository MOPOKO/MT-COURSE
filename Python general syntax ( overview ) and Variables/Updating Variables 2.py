hanging the contents of a variable is one of the essential operations. As the flow of a program progresses, data should be updated to reflect changes that have happened.

Example:

money_in_wallet = 100

sandwich_price = 30

money_in_wallet -= sandwich_price

print(money_in_wallet) 


In this case, we see, that same procedure can be shortened using -= or += instead writing whole procedure again.

Now copy the code above, and see the output in this case.
____________________________________
case = Test1
output = 70
____________________________________
money_in_wallet = 100
sandwich_price = 30
money_in_wallet -= sandwich_price
print(money_in_wallet)
